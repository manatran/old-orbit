            extremely important to us. This policy sets out how Placeholder.com
            uses and protects any information collected when you use this
            website. It’s worth a read, but if you’re short of time, here’s the
            most important stuff:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We won’t collect any personal information (eg. name, email
              address) without your explicit permission;
            </li>
            <li>We won’t send you promotional emails unless you’ve opted in</li>
            <li>

          <p>
            When we ask you to provide information by which you can be

          <h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
          <p>
            We will never collect sensitive information about you without your
            explicit consent. By ‘sensitive information’ we mean details like:

          <p>
            We also use cookies to collect non-sensitive information about your
            use of the site. This is standard on almost any website nowadays and
            allows us to understand how visitors use the site: which pages are
            most popular, which bits don&#8217;t work and so on.
          </p>
          <h3>How We Use This Data</h3>
          <p>
            We only send you promotional emails if you have explicitly opted-in.
            We do not sell, rent or share email addresses, and we never will. We
            will only share personal information when required by law (eg, if
            subpoenaed to do so).
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only pass your data on to third parties if you have
            explicitly agree that we do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason we collect information like email addresses is to provide
            you with a better service. For example, we need some personal
            details to do the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To improve our service</li>
            <li>
              Technical support (eg, if you are experiencing problems that we
              can&#8217;t replicate)
            </li>
            <li>
              User newsletters (you only receive this if you opt-in to receive
              it)
            </li>
            <li>
              To customise your user experience (eg, we can show your web hosts
              that match your requirements)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
            our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell
            an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on
            our website. Or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled
            out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that
            could be used to identify those individuals.
          </p>
          <h3>Security</h3>

            safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
